# 3-Virtual-Machine-Setup

Your task is to create a set of firewall rules in Linux that implements specific access policies (described below).

 

Note that this assignment has been split into two deliverables. The actual firewall assignment and a small setup assignment due before the full assignment to show that everything has been installed and is working.
